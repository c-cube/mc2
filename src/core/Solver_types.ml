(** Internal types (implementation)

    This modules actually implements the internal types used by the solver.
    Since mutation is heavily used in the solver, it is really, really, *really*
    discouraged to direclty use the functions in this module if you don't know the
    inner working of mSAT perfectly as even the simplest
    change can have dramatic effects on the solver.
